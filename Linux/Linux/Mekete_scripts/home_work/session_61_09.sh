## Activity File: My First Bash Script

<<'comment'
- In the previous activity you created several aliases and saved them to your `~/.bashrc` file. You may have noticed that creating long strings of commands can get a bit cumbersome when working on the command line.

- Now, we will put our commands into a script file. Reading, writing, and running Bash scripts are a staple of any good sysadmin.

- In this activity, you will create a script that completes several system audit steps automatically.

When completing this activity, consider the following:

- Start by ensuring each command will give you the expected output before adding it to your script.

- Some commands may not have been covered and require additional research.
- Add all the commands listed in the instructions to your script.
- Ensure the output of each command has a title like: `The Memory Info is:`
- Change the permissions on your script to make it executable.
- Run your script to verify it produces the correct output.

As a reminder, here are a few helpful environment and shell variables:

- `USER`
- `HOME`
- `SHELL`
- `PWD`
- `BASH`
- `HOSTNAME`
- `MACHTYPE`
- `UID`


### Instructions

Complete the following set-up:

- Create a new script file called `sys_info.sh`.

	touch sys_info.sh


- Change the permissions on the file to make it executable.

	chmod +x sys_info.sh 


- Open the file with `nano`.
	
	nano sys_info.sh
	

- Add a top `hashbang` line to make this a bash script.

	#!/bin/bash

Your script should output the following data:

- A title and today's date.

	echo "Today is" $(date)


- The `uname` info for the machine.

	echo "The machine name is" $(uname)


- The machine's IP address. (Narrow this output down to one line.)

	echo "The machine IP address is" $(hostname -I)


- The Hostname.

	echo "The hostname is $HOSTNAME"


Run your script using `./` notation.

	./sys_info.sh 

#### Bonus Script Ideas

If you complete the script above, try adding a few of these items:

- The DNS info.

- The Memory info.



- The CPU info.



- The Disk usage.

- The currently logged on users.


#!/bin/bash
comment

echo "Today is" 
date

echo  "\nThe machine name is"
uname -a

echo "\nThe machine IP address is"
hostname -I

echo "\nThe machine IP address is"
ip add | head -9 |tail -1

echo "\nThe hostname is"
hostname

echo "\nThe hostname is"
hostname -s

echo "\nThe DNS Servers are"
#systemd-resolve --status  | grep -i 'dns server'
cat /etc/resolv.conf | tail -3 | head -2

echo "\nMemory Info"
free -h

echo "\nCPU Info"
lscpu | grep CPU

echo "\nDisk Usage Info"
df -H | head -2

echo "\nWho is online"
who -a
